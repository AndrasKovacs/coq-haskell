===========

A library for formalizing Haskell types and functions in Coq

This library is a collection of types, functions, typeclasses and notations to ease representing Haskell algorithms and types directly in Coq and proving properties about them.  It does not attempt to support actual two-way extraction, so the process remains manual, but it seeks to ease some of the impedance mismatch between the two systems.
