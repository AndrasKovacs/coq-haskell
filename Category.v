(** * Category *)

(** Category theory is a language for reasoning about abstractions.
Awodey%\cite{Awodey}% calls it, "the algebra of abstract functions."  Its
power lies in relating ideas from differing disciplines, and unifying them
under a common framework.

At its heart we have the [Category].  Every category is characterized by
its objects, and the morphisms (also called arrows) between those
objects. *)

(* begin hide *)
Reserved Notation "a ~> b" (at level 90, right associativity).
Reserved Notation "f ∘ g" (at level 45).
Reserved Notation "f ≈ g" (at level 45).
Reserved Notation "C ^op" (at level 90).
(* end hide *)

Class Category := {
    ob   : Type;
    (* uhom := Type : Type; *)
    (* hom  : ob → ob → uhom where "a ~> b" := (hom a b); *)
    hom  : ob → ob → Type where "a ~> b" := (hom a b);
(**

It is important to note that objects and arrows have no inherent meaning: The
notion of a category requires only that they exist, and that they be
well-behaved.  Since all we can know about objects is that they exist, they
serve only to differentiate morphisms.  Conversely, morphisms are how we
characterize objects. *)

(** * Morphisms

In this formalization, as in many textbooks, morphisms are called [hom], for
"homomorphism" (algebraic structure-preserving maps).  Each morphism
represents the set of all morphism having that type, so they are also called
"hom-sets".

Since categories may have other categories as objects, we require that the
type of [hom] be larger than the type of its arguments.  This is the purpose
of the [uhom] type, allowing us to make use of Coq's support for universe
polymorphism.

*)

    id : ∀ {A}, A ~> A;
    compose : ∀ {A B C}, (B ~> C) → (A ~> B) → (A ~> C) where "f ∘ g" := (compose f g);
(**

We use setoids as the basis for modeling our categories, since it gives us
flexibility when defining various Haskell-like categories that depend on
isomorphisms rather than "equality on the nose".

*)

    eqv : forall a b, (a ~> b) -> (a~>b) -> Prop where "f ~~ g" := (eqv _ _ f g);
    eqv_equivalence : forall a b, Equivalence (eqv a b);
    comp_respects : forall a b c, Proper (eqv a b ==> eqv b c ==> eqv a c) (comp _ _ _)

(**

If [ob] and [hom] are the nouns of category theory, [id] and [compose] are its
fundamental verbs.  Using only these notions we can reason about concepts such
as _idempotency_, _involution_, _section_ and _retraction_, _equalizers_ and
_co-equalizers_, and more.  Before we may do so, however, we must constrain
identity and composition under three laws:

*)

    right_identity : ∀ A B (f : A ~> B), f ∘ id = f;
    left_identity : ∀ A B (f : A ~> B), id ∘ f = f;
    comp_assoc : ∀ A B C D (f : C ~> D) (g : B ~> C) (h : A ~> B),
        f ∘ (g ∘ h) = (f ∘ g) ∘ h
}.

(**

Note the difference between the arrow used for function types in Coq, such as
[A → B], and for morphisms in a category [A ~> B].  If the category must be
indicated, it is stated in the arrow: [A ~{C}~> B]. *)

(**

We may now extend our discourse about functions, using only the few terms
we've defined so far:

*)

(* begin hide *)
Section Morphisms.
Context `{C : Category}.
(* end hide *)

Definition Idempotent `(f : X ~> X) := f ∘ f = f.
Definition Involutive `(f : X ~> X) := f ∘ f = id.

(**

We can also define relationships between two functions:

*)

Definition Section' `(f : X ~> Y) := { g : Y ~> X & g ∘ f = id }.
Definition Retraction `(f : X ~> Y) := { g : Y ~> X & f ∘ g = id }.

Class SplitIdempotent {X Y : C} := {
    split_idem_retract := Y;
    split_idem         : X ~> X;
    split_idem_r       : X ~> split_idem_retract;
    split_idem_s       : split_idem_retract ~> X;
    split_idem_law_1   : split_idem_s ∘ split_idem_r = split_idem;
    split_idem_law_2   : split_idem_r ∘ split_idem_s = id/Y
}.

(**

A Σ-type (sigma type) is used to convey [Section'] and [Retraction] to make
the witness available to proofs.  The definition could be expressed with an
existential quantifier (∃), but it would not convey which [g] was chosen.

*)

Definition Epic `(f : X ~> Y)  := ∀ {Z} (g1 g2 : Y ~> Z), g1 ∘ f = g2 ∘ f → g1 = g2.
Definition Monic `(f : X ~> Y) := ∀ {Z} (g1 g2 : Z ~> X), f ∘ g1 = f ∘ g2 → g1 = g2.

Definition Bimorphic `(f : X ~> Y) := Epic f ∧ Monic f.
Definition SplitEpi `(f : X ~> Y)  := Retraction f.
Definition SplitMono `(f : X ~> Y) := Section' f.

(**

The only morphism we've seen so far is [id], but we can trivially prove it is
both _idempotent_ and _involutive_. *)

(** * Isomorphism

An isomorphism is a pair of mappings that establish an equivalence between
objects.  Using the language above, it is a pair of functions which are both
sections and retractions of one another.  That is, they compose to identity in
both directions:

*)

Class Isomorphism `{C : Category} (X Y : C) := {
  to : X ~> Y;
  from : Y ~> X;
  iso_to : to ∘ from = id/Y;
  iso_from : from ∘ to = id/X
}.

(* begin hide *)
Lemma iso_irrelevance `(C : Category) {X Y : C}

  @k = @h →
  {| to       := f
   ; from     := k
   ; iso_to   := tl
   ; iso_from := fl
  |} =
  {| to       := g
   ; from     := h
   ; iso_to   := tl'
   ; iso_from := fl'
  |}.

(* end hide *)

(**

Typically isomorphisms are characterized by this pair of functions, but they
can also be expressed as an equivalence between objects using the notation [A
≅ B].  A double-tilde is used to express the same notion of equivalence
between value terms [a ≈ b].

*)

Notation "X ≅ Y" := (Isomorphism X Y) (at level 50) : category_scope.
Notation "x ≈ y" := (to x = y ∧ from y = x) (at level 50).

(**

[id] witnesses the isomorphism between any object and itself.  Isomorphisms
are likewise symmetric and transitivity, making them parametric relations.
This will allows us to use them in proof rewriting as though they were
equalities.

(** * Sets

[Sets] is our first real category: the category of Coq types and functions.
The objects of this category are all the Coq types (including [Set], [Prop]
and [Type]), and its morphisms are functions from [Type] to [Type].  [id]
simply returns whatever object is passed, and [compose] is regular composition
between functions.  Proving it is a category in Coq is automatic.

Note that in many textbooks this category (or one similar to it) is called
just [Set], but since that name conflicts with types of the same name in Coq,
the plural is used instead.

*)

    ob      := Type;

}.

Within the category of [Sets] we can prove that monic functions are injective,
and epic functions are surjective.  This is not necessarily true in other
categories.

(** * Dual Category

The opposite, or categorical dual, of a category is expressed [C^op].  It has
the same objects as its parent, but the direction of all morphisms is flipped.
Further, doing this twice should result in the same category, making it an
involutive operation.
